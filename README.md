# rss-feed-reader-purifier
A list for your ad blocker to remove unecessary features from Feedly including paid upsells, third party sharing options, annotations, and recommendations.

## Installation
See your ad blocker's documentation for instructions on how to install 3rd party filter lists. If you are using [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) (which I recommend), see [here](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dashboard:-Filter-lists#3rd-party-filter-lists).
